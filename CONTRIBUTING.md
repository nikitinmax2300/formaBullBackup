# How To Contribute

Hello, and thank you for your interest in contributing!  At team formaBull, we love working on our projects, and we get just as excited when new volunteers show interest.  

## Tests

We write our tests with Jest and Enzyme, and ask that you also choose one of those two frameworks. 

## Submitting Pull Requests

Our [pull requests](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/formaBull/pulls) usually include the following block of markdown code:
``` markdown
# Types of changes
- [ ]  New feature (adds functionality)
- [ ]  Refactor (changes the codebase without affecting its external behavior)
- [ ]  Functional Change (fix or feature that affects codebase)
# Purpose
- 
# Approach
-

```
Please try to minimize your pull requests to only check one box at a time.  If you want to offer some refactoring, we ask that you do so separately from adding new features or significant modifications.  Co-author credit isn't necessary, but the two empty lines between the final approach and Co-authored-by ***are*** necessary for proper GitHub credit.

## Coding Standards

We follow the [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style guide for best practices.
